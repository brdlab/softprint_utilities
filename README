If you are 3D printing using Hyrel systems and custom gcode, this is a repository that might make your work easier.

Currently it contains only scripts that are relevnt to non-infill type printing. For instance these tools would help you if you want to draw patterns using DIW, embed 3D print uniaxial strain sensors or route fibers in a plane. The scripts are in python and hence, non-optimal for massive gcodes (>100,000 lines) but it is readable and super convenient for scripting such tools.

If you have any similar tool that you found or developed, let me know. I can add you as a contributor to the repository.

NOTE: These tools can't be universally applied to all types of soft material printing. They work on gcodes generated using Slic3r for printing on Hyrel machines. They may or may not work on other printers. Saying that, if you have any ideas for improving these tools (extend to 3D capabilities, multi-extruder printing, etc.) or would like help in making a specific tool for your own printing, raise an issue on github, email me or simply drop by my desk. More than happy to help and learn from you.
